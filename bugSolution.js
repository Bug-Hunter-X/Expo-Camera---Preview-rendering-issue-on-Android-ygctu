The solution involves several steps to mitigate the issue:

1. **Explicit Permissions:** Ensure you explicitly request camera permissions using `expo-permissions` before attempting to access the camera. Handle permission requests gracefully, providing feedback to the user.
2. **Component Lifecycle:** Pay close attention to the component's lifecycle methods (`componentDidMount`, `componentWillUnmount`). Ensure that the camera is properly initialized and released at the appropriate times. Avoid attempting to access the camera before it's ready.
3. **Async Operations:**  Use asynchronous functions when accessing the camera. This allows the camera to properly initialize before trying to use it. 
4. **Background Tasks:** Avoid starting camera functions while your application is in the background. If possible, implement a pause and resume mechanism to deal with background interruption. 
5. **Version compatibility:** Ensure that you're using compatible versions of Expo and related libraries. Check for updates and address any known compatibility issues.
6. **Device-Specific Workarounds:** If the problem persists on specific devices, consider adding platform-specific code to apply custom settings or handle device-specific quirks.

Here's an example using async/await:

```javascript
import * as Camera from 'expo-camera';
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions';

async function takePicture() {
  const { status } = await Permissions.askAsync(Permissions.CAMERA);
  if (status !== 'granted') {
    alert('Sorry, we need camera permissions to make this work!');
    return;
  }

  const camera = await Camera.getCameraPermissionsAsync();
  if (camera.status !== 'granted') {
    alert('Camera Permissions Denied');
    return;
  }

  // ... rest of your camera code
}
```
